      <p>
        Jordan Bernt Peterson (born June 12, 1962) is a Canadian clinical psychologist and a professor of psychology at
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Toronto" target="_blank">University of Toronto</a>. His
        main areas of study are in abnormal, social, and personality psychology, with a
        particular interest in the psychology of religious and ideological belief and the assessment and improvement of
        personality and performance.
        <br><br>
        Peterson has bachelor's degrees in political science and psychology from the University of Alberta and a Ph.D.
        in
        clinical psychology from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGill_University" target="_blank">McGill
          University</a>.
        He was a post-doctoral fellow at McGill from 1991 to 1993 before moving to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University" target="_blank">Harvard University</a>,
        where he was an assistant and then an associate professor in the psychology department.
        In 1998, he moved back to Canada as a faculty member in the psychology department at the University of Toronto,
        where eventually became a full professor.
        <br><br>
        Peterson's first book, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maps_of_Meaning" target="_blank">Maps of Meaning:
          The Architecture of Belief</a> (1999), examined several academic fields to
        describe the structure of systems of beliefs and myths, their role in the regulation of emotion, creation of
        meaning, and several other topics such as motivation for genocide.
        His second book, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Rules_for_Life" target="_blank">12 Rules for Life: An
          Antidote to Chaos</a>, was published in January 2018.
        <br><br>
        In 2016, Peterson released a series of YouTube videos criticizing political correctness and the Canadian
        government's Bill C-16, "An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code".
        The act added "gender identity and expression" as a prohibited ground of discrimination, which Peterson
        characterised as an
        introduction of compelled speech into law, although legal experts have disagreed.
        He subsequently received significant media coverage, attracting both support and criticism.
        Several writers have associated Peterson with an "Intellectual Dark Web".
